# Code-for-Short--and-Long-Term-Outcomes-After-Abdominal-Aortic-Aneurysm-Repair
This repository provides a comprehensive machine-learning pipeline for predicting both short- and long-term clinical outcomes following abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, leveraging a large multi‐center dataset from the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). The core script ingests over 185,000 patient records—encompassing demographic, anatomical, intraoperative, and postoperative variables—to train and evaluate state‐of‐the‐art classifiers (XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network) against a logistic regression baseline. Key perioperative endpoints (e.g., 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury) and long-term outcomes (e.g., 1-year survival, endoleak incidence, reintervention rates) are modeled using robust techniques for handling class imbalance (SMOTE), hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), and calibration assessment (Brier score, calibration curves).

The pipeline outputs detailed performance metrics (ROC-AUC, Brier score), confusion matrices, and calibration plots for each outcome, and includes subgroup analyses by age and aneurysm extent to ensure model generalizability. A dedicated analysis of ruptured AAAs compares observed 30-day mortality between endovascular and open repairs.
